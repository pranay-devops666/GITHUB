GITHUB Class -01 


TOPIC: GITHUB INTRODUCTION, GITHUB CLONE, PULL, PUSH, FETCH, MERGE & MERGE CONFLICTS



First we need to get/clone the code from github/central to git/local & then next do commit changes, then do push the code from git/local to 
github/central

GITHUB COMMANDS
=================

* git clone github-repo-url                 -----------------------> command to clone/get the code from github to git (central to local)
* git branches -a                           ---------------------->  command to view list of branches
* git push origin main(branch-name)         -----------------------> oommand to push the code from git to github (local to central)
* git pull -----------------------> it is the combination of fetch + merge

difference between 
* git pull origin main(branch-name) & * git fetch origin main(branch-name)

**Simple one-line interview answer (for a DevOps Engineer with 3.8 years experience):**

👉 **`git fetch origin main`** only downloads the latest changes from the remote `main` branch, while
    **`git pull origin main`** downloads and immediately merges those changes into my current local branch.

If they ask a follow-up, you can add:

> I usually use `fetch` first in production workflows to review changes before merging.
